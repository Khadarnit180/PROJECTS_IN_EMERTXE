EMETXE PROJECTS

 Project 1:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Title : Image Steganography Encoding and Decoding using C language.
• Project brief : The objective was to send a secret text file encoded inside an image of bmp file format. 
Encoded the length of the secret text and then encoded the data into the LSB of the image bytes. The 
decoding process involves decoding the length and then decoding the text bit by bit. The final output is 
the secret text after decoding.
• Technologies used: Embedded C-File operations, Pointers, Bitwise operations, Functions, Makefiles, 
Command line arguments.
 
• Key challenges & Learning:
1. Faced challenges while doing bitwise manipulation of data to embed as well to retrieve the data 
from the destination image which was solved by self-understanding.

 Project 2:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Title : Inverted search.
• Project brief: Speeds up text search in large data by tracking word locations in files. It Utilizes standard 
I/O for searching with add, update, display database user input features.
• Technologies used : data structures-hashing, Single Linked List
• Key Challenges & Learnings: Arranging the words to the specific index and checking that no of times 
they are repeated and in which files they are stored Faced challenges during the database creation to 
store the data of files.
Project 3::-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Title : Car Black Box 
• Project brief : The Car Black Box is used to log the event activities which could be investigated upon
crash. The application could be extended to any transportation system.
• Technologies used: PIC16F877A, CLCD, EEPROM, Matrix keypad, RTC, UART, I2C, Picsimlab 
board, XC8 compiler
• Key Challenges & Learning: Faced challenges while storing and retrieving events related to driving to 
and from the Eeprom.

Project 4------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
➢ Title: MP3 Tag Reader
